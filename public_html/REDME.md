### Student Grades 

* You are to develop a grade calculator that accepts a student’s scores for quizzes, mid-term, problems and final exam.  When ‘calculate’ is pressed the page will display the student’s results, including quiz average, course average, and letter grade.
<br/>

### The calculation of the grade is based on the following rules:
- Quiz Average = simple arithmetic average of the highest 4 quizzes.
- Course average is a weighted average, as follows:
- 50% for Quiz Average,
- 15% for the MidTerm,
- 10% for the Problems,
- 25% for the final exam.

* Letter grade is based on the standard 90/80/70/60 brackets, with rounding .5 up to the next highest whole percent.

### Please note that:
* You should validate the student number as the following format: (capital ‘A’ followed by exactly 8 digits, which must not all be zero).  An empty last or first name field is also a validation failure.  The make-up quiz input field, however, is the only one on the form which may be left blank.
